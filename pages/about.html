            <h1> Summary </h1>
            <p> This long, dense novel, a bestseller in the author's native Norway, offers a summary history of 
                philosophy embedded in a philosophical mystery disguised as a children's book-but only sophisticated 
                young adults would be remotely interested. Sophie Amundsen is about to turn 15 when she receives a 
                letter from one Alberto Knox, a philosopher who undertakes to educate her in his craft. Sections in 
                which we read the text of Knox's lessons to Sophie about the pre-Socratics, Plato and St. Augustine 
                alternate with those in which we find out about Sophie's life with her well-meaning mother. Soon, though, 
                Sophie begins receiving other, stranger missives addressed to one Hilde Moller Knag from her absent father, Albert.
                 As Alberto Knox's lessons approach this century, he and Sophie come to suspect that they are merely characters
                  in a novel written by Albert for his daughter. Teacher and pupil hatch a plot to understand and possibly escape 
                  from their situation; and from there, matters get only weirder. Norwegian philosophy professor Gaarder's notion 
                  of making a history of philosophy accessible is a good one. Unfortunately, it's occasionally undermined by the dry 
                  language he uses to describe the works of various thinkers and by an idiosyncratic bias that gives one paragraph to 
                  Nietzsche but dozens to Sartre, breezing right by Wittgenstein and the most influential philosophy of this century, 
                  logical positivism. Many readers, regardless of their age, may be tempted to skip over the lessons, which aren't well 
                  integrated with the more interesting and unusual metafictional story line. Author tour. (Sept.)</p>
